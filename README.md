-----------------Objective---------------------------
This repository creates a program that mines a given Java GitHub code repository. The program analyses all the commits in that repository and finds commits that have added a parameter to an existing method. 

------------------Example----------------------------------
For example, if there is a method named foo(double x) in a Java file, and a commit changes this method to be foo(double x, String y) then this code identifies the commit number that caused the change, and extracts the previous and current method signatures.

---------------------Output---------------------------------

The program generates 2 files.
1) Logfile.txt -> The intermediate git log file, that contains git diff between consecutive commits, in ascending ordr of time. 

2) Method_Diff.csv -> This is a csv file that contains the result, with commit-SHA1 in the 1st column, old method signature in the 2nd column and new method signature in the 3rd column
